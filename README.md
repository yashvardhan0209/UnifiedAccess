# UnifiedAccess Package

**UnifiedAccess** is a powerful Flutter package designed to simplify authentication and notification management. It integrates multiple authentication methods using Firebase (phone, email, Google, Apple, Facebook) and provides a unified notification service with local notifications and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), all under one unified solution.

## Features

This package provides the following functionalities:

- **Unified Authentication**: Supports multiple authentication methods, including phone verification, email login, Google, Apple, and Facebook sign-in, with custom exception handling.
- **Unified Notifications**: Manage both local notifications and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) with seamless integration and custom notification channels.
- Handle background and foreground notifications.
- Retrieve device information and FCM tokens.
- Customizable notification click callbacks for user interactions.

## Prerequisites

Before using this package, ensure you have:

1. **Firebase setup**: Add Firebase to your Flutter project. For more details, follow the official Firebase setup guide for [Flutter](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview).
2. **Google, Facebook, and Apple Sign-In Configuration**: Set up Google, Facebook, and Apple sign-in services in your Firebase console.
3. **Permissions**: Ensure your Android and iOS apps request the necessary permissions for notifications and authentication.

## How to Use

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```
   dependencies:
     unified_auth_notify: ^1.0.0
```

2. Initialize Firebase in your `main.dart`:

```
void main() async {
        WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
        await Firebase.initializeApp();
        runApp(MyApp());
}
```

3. Import and initialize `UnifiedNotification` and `UnifiedAuthentication` in your app.

```
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp();

  // Initialize authentication
  UnifiedAuthentication authenticationService = UnifiedAuthentication();

  // Initialize notifications
  UnifiedNotification notificationService = UnifiedNotification();

  await notificationService.init(
    onOpenNotification: () {
      // Custom logic when a notification is clicked
      print('Notification clicked');
    },
    defaultIcon: 'app_icon', // Provide your app icon
    enableCloudMessaging: true, // Enable Firebase Cloud Messaging
  );

  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Authentication Examples

### Phone & OTP Login

This example demonstrates how to use the UnifiedAuthentication class to perform Firebase Phone Number & OTP Login.

```
await auth.verifyPhoneNumber(
    phoneNumber: '1234567890',
    codeSent: (String verificationId, [int? forceResendingToken]) {
      final verificationId = verificationId;
      // Handle code sent (e.g., show an OTP input field)
    },
    verificationFailed: (FirebaseAuthException e) {
      // Handle verification failure
      print('Verification failed: ${e.message}');
    },
    verificationCompleted: (PhoneAuthCredential credential) {
      // Handle automatic verification
      print('Phone verified: ${credential}');
    },
    codeAutoRetrievalTimeout: (String verificationId) {
      // Handle timeout
      print('Auto retrieval timeout');
    },
);

/// verify otp
final credentials  = await auth.authenticateWithOTP(
    otp: user input otp value,
    verificationId: verificationId,
)
```

### Email Login

This example demonstrates how to use the UnifiedAuthentication class to perform Firebase Email Login.

```
try {
    UserCredential userCredential = await auth.emailLogin(
      email: 'test@example.com',
      password: 'password123',
    );
    print('Logged in as: ${userCredential.user?.email}');
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle any errors that occur during the sign-in process
    print('Login failed: ${e}');
  }
```

### Google Login

This example demonstrates how to use the UnifiedAuthentication class to perform Firebase Google Login.

```
try {
    UserCredential googleUser = await auth.signInWithGoogle();
    print('Google user: ${googleUser.user?.email}');
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle any errors that occur during the sign-in process
    print('Google sign-in failed: ${e}');
  }
```

### Apple Login

This example demonstrates how to use the UnifiedAuthentication class to perform Firebase Apple Login.

```
try {
    UserCredential userCredential = await auth.signInWithApple(
      scopes: [Scope.email, Scope.fullName],
    );
    print('Signed in with Apple as: ${userCredential.user?.email}');
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle any errors that occur during the sign-in process
    print('Apple sign-in failed: $e');
  }
```

### Facebook Login

This example demonstrates how to use the UnifiedAuthentication class to perform Firebase Facebook Login.

```
try {
    UserCredential userCredential = await auth.signInWithFacebook(
      permissions: ['email', 'public_profile'],
    );
    print('Signed in with Facebook as: ${userCredential.user?.email}');
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle any errors that occur during the sign-in process
    print('Facebook sign-in failed: $e');
  }
```

### Sign Out

This example demonstrates how to use the UnifiedAuthentication class to perform Firebase Sing Out.

```
try {
    await auth.firebaseSignOut();
    print('User successfully signed out.');
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle any errors that occur during the sign-out process
    print('Sign-out failed: $e');
  }
```

## Notification Examples

### Get FCM Token

The `getFcmToken` method retrieves the `Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) token` and device information.

```
  FcmDeviceInfoModel? deviceInfo = await notificationService.getFcmToken();

  // Print FCM token and device details
  if (deviceInfo != null) {
    print('FCM Token: ${deviceInfo.fcmToken}');
    if (deviceInfo.androidDeviceInfo != null) {
      print('Android Device Info: ${deviceInfo.androidDeviceInfo!.model}');
    } else if (deviceInfo.iosDeviceInfo != null) {
      print('iOS Device Info: ${deviceInfo.iosDeviceInfo!.name}');
    }
  }
```

### Show/Trigger Notification

The `showNotification` method is used to display a local notification.

```
  await notificationService.showNotification(
    id: 1, // Unique notification ID
    title: 'Test Notification', // Notification title
    body: 'This is a test notification body', // Notification body
  );
```

## More About the Package

UnifiedAccess simplifies the integration of Firebase Authentication and Notification services, ensuring you only need to set up once, reducing the need for multiple dependencies. Itâ€™s designed for developers who want to streamline user authentication and push notifications, especially for apps that require multiple sign-in options and local/FCM notifications.

By using UnifiedAccess, you eliminate the complexity of handling various authentication and notification services individually, allowing you to focus on building amazing features in your app.
